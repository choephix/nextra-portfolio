# Hey there, I'm Stefan

I am a full-stack **web developer** by day and **game developer** by night, bringing a unique perspective and versatility to every project I work on. With over 13 years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills and the ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and deliver professional quality products.
I am a stickler for good user experience and I strive to create beautiful, functional, and high-performance products.

Take a look at my work, and if you have any questions or would like to discuss a project, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to chat. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
